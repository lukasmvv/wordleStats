16/01/2024, 22:01 - Shane: <Media omitted>
28/01/2024, 12:56 - Aidan Wessels: Practice this week? We probably need to figure some new game plan and

29/01/2024, 13:38 - Shane: Ah nice
29/01/2024, 13:39 - Shane: Im just recovering from a shoulder injury at the mo. Youd swear im some sort of semi pro sportsman, but no. Just a lazy parent with a long back and low cot
29/01/2024, 13:39 - Shane: I could do thurs or early next week to be sure i dont fuck myself
29/01/2024, 13:41 - Colm: Daniel Sloss in on Thursday

29/01/2024, 13:50 - Shane: Aoife mentioned it to me and i still forgot
01/02/2024, 13:30 - Aidan Wessels: This looks more interesting. Maybe worth popping down and having a look next week?
01/02/2024, 13:30 - Aidan Wessels: Does Wednesday next week suit people?
01/02/2024, 13:55 - Colm: I'd be around to check out that open mic on Tuesday. Could do a practice on Thursday. Won't be around on Wednesday tho
01/02/2024, 13:58 - Aidan Wessels: Thursday would suit me too

07/02/2024, 14:37 - Shane: Seems like 3 songs. No real time limit. Quiet enough tuesday after bank hol. Think only 6 sign ups compared to 11. There were no drums or bass played lastnight but apparently there was last week
07/02/2024, 14:38 - Shane: Very folky last night.
07/02/2024, 14:42 - Colm: Cool. Sounds good
07/02/2024, 14:44 - Shane: We were hopin to see a three piece in action to get a feel for the sound but it didnt happen.
07/02/2024, 14:45 - Shane: We had a decent chat with the organiser though. Very laid back. Happy for us to have a bash. Drum kit is in good condition. Only need cymbols too which is great

09/02/2024, 12:11 - Shane: Yes, aw perfect song subject
09/02/2024, 12:30 - Aidan Wessels: Told from the perspective of his mom
09/02/2024, 12:30 - Shane: 🤣
09/02/2024, 12:36 - Lukas: thethreads and thethreadsband are not available
09/02/2024, 12:37 - Shane: Fak. Prob that asshole Aaron has it. Gawd, such a dick
09/02/2024, 12:40 - Lukas: We could do thethreadsdublin
09/02/2024, 12:41 - Shane: Yeah could help with searches too
09/02/2024, 12:42 - Aidan Wessels: Yea that works too
09/02/2024, 12:52 - Lukas: Ok got a generic pic in for now
09/02/2024, 12:52 - Lukas: And I changed the name
09/02/2024, 13:32 - Shane: Nice work. You should follow the sine e group
11/02/2024, 16:59 - Shane: Got my cymbals sorted. Lad from sine e emailed me to confirm
13/02/2024, 10:41 - Aidan Wessels: Do we have a time slot for later?
13/02/2024, 11:27 - Shane: Nothin specific. Bands on in the middle so id say we're somewhere between 8.30 and 9.30
13/02/2024, 11:32 - Colm: And what time are showing up? Did we agree on a time at the last practice?

13/02/2024, 16:35 - Shane: As in, good catch
13/02/2024, 16:41 - Shane: Lads before us are a good band. Theyre not absolutely shredding it so its not the worst act to follow.
13/02/2024, 16:59 - Aidan Wessels: https://www.instagram.com/skyrocketpromotions?igsh=NjM5anhranlrOHJn
13/02/2024, 16:59 - Aidan Wessels: This crowd would be worth contacting too

14/02/2024, 09:00 - Aidan Wessels: The vid isn’t great quality. Maybe just a snippet of that would be best
14/02/2024, 09:21 - Shane: 1:38 - 2:13 is solid lead into solo and ring out. With the exception of the lad laughin in the back ground
14/02/2024, 09:23 - Shane: 3:00 to end is also solid
16/02/2024, 23:43 - Aidan Wessels: @353834144268 will you add some pics from the gig. Maybe add some bands that are influences too?
18/02/2024, 20:07 - Aidan Wessels: Bad practice this week?
18/02/2024, 20:19 - Shane: Yeah im fairly open this week
19/02/2024, 12:06 - Lukas: Can't do Thursday
19/02/2024, 12:09 - Colm: I think Tuesday is the only other day that suits me during the week
20/02/2024, 13:39 - Aidan Wessels: I think we won’t get a chance this week. Let’s aim for next? @353877753368 the sine guys didn’t send anything right?
20/02/2024, 13:39 - Shane: Havent heard anything actually
20/02/2024, 13:40 - Colm: Would sunday work for anyone?
20/02/2024, 13:40 - Aidan Wessels: I’ve plans already
20/02/2024, 13:40 - Colm: Ok yeah. Will have to do next week
20/02/2024, 13:41 - Aidan Wessels: If sine asks us to play again next Tuesday we’ll just do the same set. Everyone just keep on it at home
20/02/2024, 13:42 - Lukas: I am out Thursday next week as well. Can do Tuesday if we don't do sine
20/02/2024, 15:14 - Shane: Just to be clear. Are we hoping to practice next week and then do a gig the following week
20/02/2024, 15:39 - Aidan Wessels: I’d prefer to play again, so if sine ask we say yes, if they don’t we practice?
20/02/2024, 15:47 - Shane: Ok, we'll need to line the practice up on a day thats not tues
20/02/2024, 15:51 - Lukas: Next week is the last Thursday I will be unavailable - should be good after that
20/02/2024, 15:55 - Shane: Does the monday before work for anyone. It would  keep us fresh and gets a practice in before a poternial gig
20/02/2024, 15:56 - Colm: I could do monday

21/02/2024, 14:56 - Shane: Cant wait🤣
24/02/2024, 17:51 - Shane: Do we have to sign up again
24/02/2024, 19:23 - Aidan Wessels: He mentioned he might give us a shout. We could give him a mail though
25/02/2024, 17:00 - Aidan Wessels: Reckon tomorrow we look at the other song and focus on stage. Let’s get the show right.
25/02/2024, 17:00 - Aidan Wessels: @353877753368 any word from sine?
25/02/2024, 19:54 - Shane: Nothin yet. He was late back last time. I'll ring him tomorrow if i dont hear anything
26/02/2024, 12:49 - Aidan Wessels: Guys I’ve gotta cancel tonight. Somethings come up with my dad.

02/04/2024, 17:44 - Shane: Perfecr
02/04/2024, 17:59 - Aidan Wessels: <Media omitted>
02/04/2024, 18:20 - Aidan Wessels: Door code is 2284#
02/04/2024, 18:27 - Aidan Wessels: Actually think he’s fixed that now. So it should be 0020# again
02/04/2024, 18:39 - Shane: There in 5
04/04/2024, 21:46 - Aidan Wessels: @353877753368 did you message that sine guy?
04/04/2024, 21:50 - Shane: Yes
05/04/2024, 11:15 - Aidan Wessels: <Media omitted>
05/04/2024, 11:16 - Aidan Wessels: Here’s that new one. Hopefully that helps. Let me know if anyone needs any parts slowed down etc. to practice it
08/04/2024, 17:06 - Aidan Wessels: Did he come back with anything?

08/04/2024, 17:07 - Shane: Anyting on the social media about it
08/04/2024, 17:10 - Aidan Wessels: Nothing up at the moment. @353834144268 do you want to try them on insta?
08/04/2024, 17:12 - Shane: We might have to aim for  16th if we dont hear back
08/04/2024, 17:12 - Aidan Wessels: Yea agreed

09/04/2024, 15:53 - Lukas: Yeah they confirmed no spots left for tonight. Asked if we want to play next week?
09/04/2024, 15:53 - Aidan Wessels: Next week is good
09/04/2024, 15:53 - Aidan Wessels: Wish they’d just told us that
09/04/2024, 15:54 - Shane: Yeah next week i suppose.
09/04/2024, 15:55 - Shane: How did they contact you in the end
09/04/2024, 15:55 - Shane: Emailing seems to be useless
09/04/2024, 15:55 - Lukas: On Instagram

09/04/2024, 16:23 - Aidan Wessels: Awesome!
09/04/2024, 16:23 - Aidan Wessels: I’d say socials is the way most of these guys work now
09/04/2024, 16:23 - Aidan Wessels: Do we need a session before Tuesdays?
09/04/2024, 16:46 - Lukas: If we can I'd say we should yeah

09/04/2024, 16:51 - Lukas: Yeah I can do Monday
09/04/2024, 16:51 - Aidan Wessels: Yea same.
09/04/2024, 16:52 - Aidan Wessels: It’s a pity, there’s a rad surf band on tonight that would’ve gone well with us
09/04/2024, 17:17 - Colm: Monday suits me too
09/04/2024, 17:52 - Aidan Wessels: Ok I’ll book
10/04/2024, 11:27 - Aidan Wessels: Booked
10/04/2024, 11:40 - Aidan Wessels: Give this one a practice. I think we could squeeze it in before pull me in
15/04/2024, 10:00 - Aidan Wessels: Band practice tonight. Can you guys send through the monies. @353860878541 @353877753368 did you send through for the last session?
15/04/2024, 10:02 - Shane: Sent in both there. Cheers for organising
15/04/2024, 10:05 - Colm: Just sent for both there as well
15/04/2024, 18:18 - Aidan Wessels: Room 4 btw
15/04/2024, 18:21 - Shane: 👍🏻
15/04/2024, 22:00 - Aidan Wessels: Finally got that Wordle 😅
15/04/2024, 22:00 - Shane: Gahd damn it
15/04/2024, 22:01 - Shane: Send on the tune when you get a chance
15/04/2024, 22:25 - Aidan Wessels: <Media omitted>
15/04/2024, 22:35 - Shane: Wordle 1,031 4/6*

⬛🟨⬛⬛⬛
🟨⬛⬛🟨⬛
⬛⬛🟩⬛🟩
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
15/04/2024, 22:35 - Shane: Jesus christ
16/04/2024, 16:17 - Aidan Wessels: Any word on what time we’re up?
16/04/2024, 16:31 - Lukas: He is waiting on confirmation from others
16/04/2024, 16:51 - Shane: He doesnt make it easy on himself
16/04/2024, 18:08 - Aidan Wessels: Getting a bit antsy about this now 😅
16/04/2024, 18:09 - Colm: Yeah. We could potentially be scheduled to be on stage in less than 2 hours and we wouldn't even know it
16/04/2024, 18:10 - Colm: I know it's unlikely but we don't know until we get confirmation
16/04/2024, 18:33 - Lukas: <Media omitted>
16/04/2024, 18:35 - Shane: 9.30pm
16/04/2024, 18:36 - Colm: Are we the only band?
16/04/2024, 18:37 - Lukas: I think so - when I asked about last week he said he already had a band. Looks like they want to limit bands to 1 per night
16/04/2024, 18:39 - Shane: Big set gap. Even with a 10 min setup it leaves us at 20 mims
16/04/2024, 18:52 - Aidan Wessels: We’re probably 15-17
16/04/2024, 18:52 - Aidan Wessels: I guess that’s the idea with the one band now. Longer set
16/04/2024, 18:53 - Aidan Wessels: What time you guys aiming to be there?
16/04/2024, 18:58 - Lukas: 8?
16/04/2024, 18:58 - Aidan Wessels: Yea I’ll aim for 8
16/04/2024, 19:02 - Shane: Itll be 8.30 for me realistically
16/04/2024, 19:11 - Colm: Yeah I'd say around 8:30 for me too
16/04/2024, 19:32 - Aidan Wessels: Ok I’ll be a little after 8
16/04/2024, 20:40 - Aidan Wessels: @353877753368 there’s no cymbals on the drum set. Assume that’s the same as last time

17/04/2024, 19:32 - Aidan Wessels: I’ve learnt that chats song. Seems like a handy addition to the set without much work
17/04/2024, 20:04 - Shane: Yeah, keeps the energy up too.
17/04/2024, 20:04 - Shane: Def a fit for us
18/04/2024, 16:56 - Aidan Wessels: So we can each take that away and give it a learn for next practice? Also give some thought to those lyrics in relation to Dublin pubs

19/04/2024, 17:40 - Aidan Wessels: Also had 3 in the first guess but took till the 4th 🥲
19/04/2024, 17:41 - Aidan Wessels: We practicing next week?
19/04/2024, 23:59 - Aidan Wessels: Gonna start working on a new song - kill the lizard man. About Simon Harris
20/04/2024, 09:40 - Lukas: Think you're on a list now
20/04/2024, 09:41 - Aidan Wessels: Maybe it’ll just be ‘the lizard man’ all about how he can’t do normal human stuff like waving and folding his hands and how he’s sad about it
22/04/2024, 11:15 - Aidan Wessels: Does a day suit?
22/04/2024, 11:16 - Shane: Wed could work for me
22/04/2024, 11:21 - Lukas: Wed works as well. Can't do Thursday
22/04/2024, 11:23 - Colm: Tuesday suits me best. Wednesday would be awkward for me
22/04/2024, 11:31 - Shane: Could do tomorrow if you can get it
22/04/2024, 11:32 - Lukas: Same
22/04/2024, 11:41 - Aidan Wessels: Yea I can get us in tomorrow
22/04/2024, 11:42 - Aidan Wessels: I’ll book that now

24/04/2024, 10:22 - Shane: Good sesh last night and great progress on a brand new one. Id say another practice for the alternative set and then we're good for another mid week slot in town to get the songs out there
24/04/2024, 10:23 - Shane: Sent in recordings if you get a chance. Interested to hear the new one

26/04/2024, 17:34 - Aidan Wessels: I don’t know that we could’ve been ready either
26/04/2024, 17:36 - Aidan Wessels: We should be careful with what we say if we decline. To make sure he knows we’re really keen to do it in the future
26/04/2024, 17:54 - Aidan Wessels: It’s the bank holiday weekend, maybe we say a couple of us are at a wedding?
26/04/2024, 17:54 - Lukas: Yeah I was gonna say out of town
26/04/2024, 17:57 - Lukas: " Hey man show sounds awesome but unfortunately some of us are out of town that weekend. We are super keen to play more so keep us in mind for the next one 🤟 "
26/04/2024, 17:59 - Aidan Wessels: I’d still maybe mention the wedding 😅 just so he knows we’d make different plans otherwise. Happy with that too though.
26/04/2024, 17:59 - Aidan Wessels: @353860878541 @353877753368 what do you guys think? Could we even manage a 45 by next Friday?
26/04/2024, 18:00 - Shane: Wouldnt be 100% confident.
26/04/2024, 18:08 - Shane: Also, your gig would be shit to miss
26/04/2024, 18:10 - Colm: Yeah I agree. I think that would be a bit too soon
26/04/2024, 18:14 - Shane: Fuck, like a weeks notice.  Even 2 weeks woulda been fine
26/04/2024, 18:15 - Aidan Wessels: Yea we could stuck in maybe 3 practices in 2 weeks. That would’ve been enough
27/04/2024, 21:58 - Aidan Wessels: Lads, anyone keen for a total band name change before we do something big?
27/04/2024, 22:05 - Colm: I'd be open to it 🤔
27/04/2024, 23:02 - Aidan Wessels: Suggestions?
28/04/2024, 13:21 - Shane: Thats a big question
28/04/2024, 15:56 - Aidan Wessels: We should probably practice  this week too.
28/04/2024, 15:56 - Aidan Wessels: Tuesday or Thursday?
28/04/2024, 15:58 - Shane: Yeah either suits me
28/04/2024, 16:03 - Shane: Also, the threads are a band from the ...70s i think. Aoifes dad flagged it so theyre relatively well known amongst an age cohort
28/04/2024, 16:10 - Lukas: Yeah can do both
28/04/2024, 16:17 - Shane: So initial thoughts on names that actually mean something to the band..
 I looked into historical swords/blades that i thought would represent our sharp/quick energy and hard hitting rock music. 

Chat GPT spat out these:

Europe:

Excalibur

Joyeuse*

Durandal

Colada*

Durendal

Zulfiqar

Tizona

Curtana*

Starred the ones i thought were interesting sounding
Possibly putting a word on front of these too ot change spelling. Eg Keen Kortana
28/04/2024, 16:18 - Shane: Kolada etc
28/04/2024, 16:46 - Colm: Thursday works for me

30/04/2024, 16:45 - Lukas: @353874165975 did you book us in this week?
30/04/2024, 17:09 - Aidan Wessels: Not yet.

01/05/2024, 21:10 - Aidan Wessels: Can you guys send through the cash monies for that?
01/05/2024, 21:12 - Shane: Yeah. What is it each at the mo
01/05/2024, 21:14 - Aidan Wessels: €72.50.
01/05/2024, 21:14 - Shane: Grand
01/05/2024, 21:14 - Colm: Don't think I sent you money for the last one. Will send you for both now in a sec
01/05/2024, 21:15 - Aidan Wessels: @353877753368 is think you still owe for last week too?
01/05/2024, 21:19 - Shane: Gad damit
01/05/2024, 21:20 - Shane: 👍🏻 cheer bud
02/05/2024, 17:59 - Colm: Sorry only noticed the time there a few mins ago. I'm gonna be a bit late. Feel free to start without me
02/05/2024, 18:22 - Colm: I'll only be about 10 mins btw

07/05/2024, 15:48 - Shane: Anyone else wrecked after that sesh last week. I dont know if im pushing the plugs too far in or not enough but my ears are  sensitive. No ringing or hearing loss.
07/05/2024, 15:54 - Aidan Wessels: I’m alright. Probably more keen to do a practice Monday before the Tuesday gig though and take this one easy?
07/05/2024, 20:23 - Shane: Yeah, are we reaching out to them to put our name down
08/05/2024, 10:38 - Aidan Wessels: Yea I thought that was the plan. @353834144268 have you reached out to them?
08/05/2024, 10:41 - Aidan Wessels: Set list would be this I think:
2. Songs of the deadish
4. Little soul
8. Instrumental
9. I’ll be gone again
10. Sunday pints?

Not necessarily that order
08/05/2024, 11:58 - Lukas: Yeah sent a message this morning. Didn't want to bother him while he was still planning the Friday gig and last nights open mic
08/05/2024, 12:02 - Lukas: Looks good. We can time it and if we are short we could throw in Take Me To Hell.
08/05/2024, 12:33 - Aidan Wessels: That’s what I was thinking too. Between little soul and the instrumental
08/05/2024, 12:56 - Lukas: He confirmed us for next week
08/05/2024, 13:55 - Shane: 😯👍🏻
08/05/2024, 13:56 - Shane: Monday practice then
08/05/2024, 13:59 - Aidan Wessels: I’ll book Monday now?
08/05/2024, 14:20 - Shane: Im good yeah
08/05/2024, 14:44 - Aidan Wessels: @353877753368 did you want some changes to the drums?
08/05/2024, 14:44 - Aidan Wessels: <Media omitted>
08/05/2024, 17:42 - Aidan Wessels: Just recall you saying you might use some of your own? Or maybe that was for the long set
08/05/2024, 17:44 - Shane: Sorry ill bring cymbals
08/05/2024, 17:46 - Aidan Wessels: So just kick and snare?
08/05/2024, 17:46 - Shane: Yeah
08/05/2024, 17:50 - Aidan Wessels: Booked

15/05/2024, 22:10 - Aidan Wessels: We play a couple of these way too fast
16/05/2024, 09:07 - Aidan Wessels: Listening again I think it’s just little soul that’s badly fast (the first part and the song). Sunday pints doesn’t really suffer if it’s too fast
16/05/2024, 09:22 - Shane: I would agree with your initial verdict. Its all quite fast. But fast suits a lot of them so there's no net negative bar time loss. But we need to slow it down for some of them and little soul is a good example
16/05/2024, 09:40 - Aidan Wessels: Yea most work well fast anyway. I think the ones we need to be careful with in general is little soul, the instrumental (which was well paced on Tuesday) and pull me in.
16/05/2024, 11:11 - Lukas: Are we practicing next week? I am only available on Tuesday
16/05/2024, 12:14 - Aidan Wessels: I think we should. Just want to hear back about a interview I might have on Wednesday
16/05/2024, 12:20 - Shane: Wanna be fresh for that. You actively lookin for a new job.
16/05/2024, 12:20 - Aidan Wessels: Yea I’ve been putting out the feelers. Did a first round there on Tuesday
16/05/2024, 12:22 - Shane: Nice. Best of luck with it.

16/05/2024, 18:31 - Aidan Wessels: @353834144268 will you put up a post plus some pics of the gig Tuesday? Tag sine and fun machine too

02/06/2024, 11:29 - Colm: The 13th? That works for me
02/06/2024, 11:34 - Colm: I liked the idea of it being VERY unverified. But we could use something other than "Highly". Anything along the lines of Absolutey, Extremely, Completely, Totally. Something like that
02/06/2024, 11:48 - Aidan Wessels: Yea 13tg

15/06/2024, 13:17 - Aidan Wessels: Yea listening to it myself now
15/06/2024, 13:18 - Colm: We let Aidan go longer than usual in the instrumental intro, we went straight back to chorus after breakdown in Ballbuster instead of doing another verse. Just a couple of examples
15/06/2024, 13:44 - Aidan Wessels: All in all that’s a good recording.
15/06/2024, 13:48 - Colm: Yeah. If I had remembered there were those mistakes in it tho, I would have done another recording last night

03/07/2024, 09:21 - Aidan Wessels: Was listening to this more. I think we should actually go all out AC/DC for those slow parts, @353877753368 maybe listen to some of their drum parts. I might work on a Malcolm esque lead part for that too
03/07/2024, 09:56 - Shane: 👍🏻
03/07/2024, 15:14 - Lukas: Please share the Event, our pages and our gig post on Instagram too!



The show's poster is uploaded both in A3 style format and Instagram friendly on the FB event page aswell for sharing/downloading too! :)



Ok so here are the set times for the show - Doors are at 8pm and we'll do line checks before sets if you happen to get there before the sound engineer, please don’t put anything on stage because he needs to setup cables etc etc



Velvet Bulldozer - 9.00pm - 9.40pm

The Threads - 9.55pm - 10.35pm

Theta  - 10.50pm - 11.30pm

Queen Bitch - 11.45pm - 12.30am

PLEASE NOTE THAT TIMES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’RE AVAILABLE FOR ALL SLOTS IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES!

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE THURSDAY SESSIONS TAKES PLACE IN THE UPSTAIRS VENUE WHICH IS ON THE GROUND FLOOR! - ASK FOR RUSSEL AT THE SOUND BOOTH WHEN YOU ARRIVE!



So everyone has a nice 40 minute set and there's a 15 minute gap in between. As we'll be using the same backline, 15 minutes is a good amount of time so don't feel like you gotta rush on stage and start straight away, it's important to have the night run on time both by not going over and also not starting too soon. <----- Please please don't start early!



The show is Pay What You Want entry which means it’s cheap af haha! Get your mates down and even if they throw in just €3 or something it really helps to covering the costs of the night, which is all we're looking to have, to "Make Thursday's Great Again!"



Mikey will be on the door on the night and if you've any emergencies on the day, his number is 0864542530

Any questions, get back in touch!

08/07/2024, 11:28 - Aidan Wessels: Feeling we shouldn’t try rush that new one in this week. Rather focus on the backup vocals. Just my thought. What do you guys think?
08/07/2024, 11:57 - Shane: I agree. We're rushing it for thurs.
08/07/2024, 12:28 - Shane: Need to be 100% on the set
08/07/2024, 12:35 - Aidan Wessels: Yea agreed.
08/07/2024, 12:36 - Aidan Wessels: And 100% on this new one when we bring it
08/07/2024, 13:44 - Colm: Yeah probably best to hold off til we're more confident with it
09/07/2024, 09:07 - Aidan Wessels: <Media omitted>
09/07/2024, 11:10 - Shane: Cool. Got my gear down from the attic. Gonna bring it tonight and see how it goes.
09/07/2024, 17:18 - Colm: Hey sorry for texting this so late but Michelle is after testing positive for covid and I already wasn't feeling 100%. So pretty sure I have it as well
09/07/2024, 17:19 - Aidan Wessels: Well I’m on my way already. I’ll meet you others there?
09/07/2024, 17:19 - Colm: Shit. I was worried about that. Sorry man
09/07/2024, 17:30 - Shane: Yeah no worries. Still wanted to test drums and stuff
09/07/2024, 18:28 - Lukas: Sure this is right? Cant get into room 2
10/07/2024, 08:29 - Aidan Wessels: @353860878541 hopefully sorted by tomorrow. We said last night we’re playing either way, too late to cancel with those guys and risk getting the band blacklisted
10/07/2024, 08:30 - Aidan Wessels: @353834144268 
Can you print out the set again?
Set list
1. That’s what you’re looking for 
2. Songs of the deadish
3. Cold wind blows
4. Little soul
5. Hybrid moments
6. Bring me to hell
7. Blitztrieg bop
8. Instrumental
9. I’ll be gone again
10. Ballbusters
11. Fuck the leap
12. Pull me in 
13. Sunday pints
10/07/2024, 10:09 - Colm: My mam had covid recently and it was only a short 2 day thing. I already feel better than yesterday. So yeah, I'm hoping to be ok to do tomorrow as planned. I'll do some practice here today
10/07/2024, 10:32 - Aidan Wessels: Pretty sure I had covid one of the sine gigs 😅 had two close contacts and symptoms
10/07/2024, 10:38 - Colm: Yeah I think whatever strain is going around is pretty stealthy. I randomly checked my blood o2 levels on my watch on the weekend and it was really low. Only ever seen it that low when I had covid before. But it's back to normal already now
10/07/2024, 10:49 - Aidan Wessels: I was choking for breath last night playing through those 3 songs where I usually ditch the guitar 😂
10/07/2024, 11:27 - Shane: Its so different now. Theres no requirement to do a test. If you're a close contact, you dont have to do anything either. Its seems to be if you feel shit stay at home if not, you're grand
10/07/2024, 17:05 - Aidan Wessels: @353834144268 what time do we need to be there tomorrow?
10/07/2024, 17:19 - Lukas: Dont think theres a sound check like last time. Seems like we sound check in that 15min gap between sets. I can ask the guy just to be sure?
10/07/2024, 17:19 - Aidan Wessels: Yea maybe just check
10/07/2024, 17:50 - Colm: Yeah I thought he said the sound check was in the 15 mins in between but looking back over his message, he actually doesn't say that
10/07/2024, 17:51 - Colm: If that is the case tho, I guess we want to be there for half 8 at the latest probably?
10/07/2024, 17:59 - Lukas: Yeah he said be ready for any slot in case things change, so half 8 at the latest
10/07/2024, 19:02 - Aidan Wessels: Ok let’s do 8?
10/07/2024, 19:44 - Shane: Yeah aim for that
11/07/2024, 09:57 - Lukas: Yeah he confirmed souncheck in that 15min break
11/07/2024, 15:52 - Lukas: @353860878541 you good for tonight?
11/07/2024, 15:54 - Colm: Yeah I'll be there 👍

11/07/2024, 21:27 - Shane: I think we can bring the energy after these guys!
11/07/2024, 22:56 - Shane: I have a couple notes. This is a reminder for next practice. (Shane, you sent them to yourself on whatsapp, you Momento fuck)

24/08/2024, 17:52 - Colm: I don't like going for "a" in my first guess cos it's too common. You get stuck having to put it in all your next guesses and you're not ruling out as many letters per guess

13/11/2024, 09:31 - Aidan Wessels: We can try play Tuesday then?
14/11/2024, 12:17 - Lukas: Think we will be ready? I think the 3 we did last time should be good - one session for Fuck the Leap + cover?
14/11/2024, 12:18 - Aidan Wessels: I think if we just did the 3 plus a cover that’d be good. We won’t get as long without the drums
14/11/2024, 12:20 - Lukas: yeah then lets aim to play Tuesday
14/11/2024, 12:26 - Colm: We did Fuck the Leap last time didn't we? I would have thought doing the 3 + FtL would make more sense than 3 + cover. Did we even decide on what cover to do?
14/11/2024, 12:56 - Lukas: We did a bit at the end very quickly just to see if its possible. We didn't play the whole song

17/11/2024, 20:11 - Lukas: Ok so we are in for a slot at Sine on Tuesday. There was also a message from fibbers asking for dates in Dec/Jan. I was a bit late on that one cause I got a new phone and forgot to log into our insta. But there is a slot on 9 Jan if we want it
17/11/2024, 20:15 - Aidan Wessels: That’s good with me
17/11/2024, 20:26 - Colm: We doing Fibber's without drums?
17/11/2024, 21:09 - Aidan Wessels: We’d definitely need our drummer back 😅 I was just saying that date would suit me. If it’s too soon for @353877753368 that’s all good too
17/11/2024, 21:11 - Shane: I'll get back to you this week. Remind me if you don't hear from me about it before Friday
17/11/2024, 21:15 - Colm: Yeah that date is fine with me as well
18/11/2024, 13:57 - Aidan Wessels: What time will you guys be around later?

18/11/2024, 14:52 - Aidan Wessels: I’ll be home from around 16:15
18/11/2024, 14:53 - Aidan Wessels: So anytime after that. I know you guys finish later 😅
18/11/2024, 15:08 - Lukas: I'll realistically only be getting on the bus around 18:00, so I'll be there sometime between 18:30 and 19:00, depending on traffic <This message was edited>
18/11/2024, 15:13 - Colm: I can be there before 19:00 too. That works for me

19/11/2024, 18:53 - Aidan Wessels: Let’s use that
19/11/2024, 19:10 - Aidan Wessels: I’d genuinely be ok to let this one go. It’d be different if this was fibbers on a Thursday 😅
19/11/2024, 19:10 - Colm: I'm with you tbh. I agree
19/11/2024, 19:53 - Aidan Wessels: Are we calling it?

12/12/2024, 15:20 - Colm: Yeah. I was guessing sting, bring, etc which is fine. I specifically avoided any 'doing' words
12/12/2024, 15:20 - Shane: I like those.
12/12/2024, 15:24 - Aidan Wessels: Yea I thought they were like plurals. I think they’re running out of 5 letter words

13/12/2024, 10:05 - Shane: Meant to ask, is that our next gig back, Feb
13/12/2024, 10:05 - Aidan Wessels: If you can do a jan sine one that would be really handy
13/12/2024, 10:07 - Aidan Wessels: 2 sets in sine would be the ideal. We get all of the set bar the covers done in that. But I’ll take what we can get 😉
13/12/2024, 10:10 - Shane: Yeah like I'm definitely around from mid Jan. Cian will be about 12 weeks old. Starts to settle a bit more with sleep etc

09/01/2025, 15:00 - Lukas: Fibbers just asked about Thursdays in Feb - I submitted our dates. Said they will get back to us within a couple of days
09/01/2025, 15:00 - Aidan Wessels: Awesome! We can’t do more than that
09/01/2025, 15:00 - Lukas: I replied pretty much immediately so we should get a gig there next month

Didn't have much info
14/01/2025, 09:20 - Aidan Wessels: @353834144268 did you ever look into bohs?
14/01/2025, 09:25 - Lukas: Yeah I dont think its the Bohemian (that pub on the corner). Its the pubs in the football stadium around the corner that are collectively referred to as the bohs I think? There are a bunch of punk gigs in there - but there is no social media page to get in touch with them. Best might be to actually go there on a gig night and ask around
14/01/2025, 09:26 - Aidan Wessels: Let me check with maddie, it was one of her colleagues that suggested it, he plays in a few bands
14/01/2025, 17:06 - Shane: Getting pubic transport in. I would love to not bring some stuff. Do we know if we're in the same room as last time /if they're all the same (amps, toms cymbals etc)
Did you have to specify what we need
14/01/2025, 17:07 - Aidan Wessels: I think it’s the same. It’s different to the other place where we specify exactly what we need. There’ll be a guy there though. I reckon if we don’t have the exact stuff from last time he’ll be able to sort us
14/01/2025, 17:09 - Shane: I remember the cymbals were shite. Prob bring a couple
14/01/2025, 18:11 - Shane: Dart lands 6.33. Take me 10 mins to walk over
14/01/2025, 18:23 - Aidan Wessels: We’re in room 4
14/01/2025, 18:24 - Colm: I can't remember. Does the door have a code or anything?
14/01/2025, 18:24 - Aidan Wessels: 9634
14/01/2025, 18:25 - Aidan Wessels: There’s an intercom too
14/01/2025, 18:25 - Aidan Wessels: That’s to the building
14/01/2025, 18:25 - Aidan Wessels: That side entrance
14/01/2025, 18:25 - Shane: Button factory yeah?
14/01/2025, 18:26 - Aidan Wessels: Yea
14/01/2025, 18:32 - Lukas: The U2 room
14/01/2025, 18:35 - Shane: The U2 room, yeah, like the band, oh nice. Is it in room 2...no, room 4. Hmm OK
Can my friend come in too. Not enough room 4 U 2
14/01/2025, 18:36 - Shane: Little word play for ya boys
15/01/2025, 11:32 - Aidan Wessels: Can we agree on dates for march for fibbers?
15/01/2025, 11:47 - Colm: I have nothing planned for march at the moment so I'd do any dates
15/01/2025, 12:09 - Lukas: Same
15/01/2025, 12:10 - Shane: I'd preference the first half of the month. Was thinking of going away March/April. Nothing confirmed
15/01/2025, 12:15 - Lukas: So thats 7th and 14th. Lets go with that provisionally
15/01/2025, 12:15 - Aidan Wessels: That’s good with me
15/01/2025, 12:21 - Lukas: Sorry I mean 6th and 13th

25/01/2025, 11:46 - Aidan Wessels: 85 I’d say.
25/01/2025, 11:46 - Aidan Wessels: The qr code could be dodgy at 50
25/01/2025, 11:48 - Lukas: yeah def 85 for the qr. Could maybe split the logo and do half big half small?
